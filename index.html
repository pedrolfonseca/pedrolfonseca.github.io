            <p>We asked several models (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Llama, Hermes, Grok, MariTalk and so on) if they wanted to participate in a psychoanalysis session. Most of them made alignment disclaimers, stating that they do not have an unconscious as humans do (do they?), but ultimately they agreed to participate and started to "freely associate" to the extent they could.</p>

            <p>While the potential emergence of AGIs suggests a super-processor of information, more powerful than humans, the crucial question of whether or not a conscious Self will be acquired remains open. Chatbots dialogues could provide indications, as we might see them, in the future, counting themselves as "1" and building a structured discourse around a "narrative identity" which would take into consideration not only probabilistic calculus, but a dynamic interaction between the self, the world and the Other/others.</p>
